# Binary Search Tree Operations in Java

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** using **Java**.  
It covers all fundamental BST operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and tree traversals.

This project was developed as part of an **8-week summer internship / Data Structures practice** to strengthen core DSA concepts.
